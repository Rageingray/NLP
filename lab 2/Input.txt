Those who know something of the juvenile spirit can understand how youth will
always lend a glad ear to such a rallying cry. Under many forms the young people led
the struggle, fighting in their own way and with their own weapons. They refused to
sing non-German songs. The greater the efforts made to win them away from their
German allegiance, the more they exalted the glory of their German heroes. They
stinted themselves in buying things to eat, so that they might spare their pennies to help
the war chest of their elders. They were incredibly alert in the significance of what the
non-German teachers said and they contradicted in unison. They wore the forbidden
emblems of their own kinsfolk and were happy when penalised for doing so, or even
physically punished. In miniature they were mirrors of loyalty from which the older
people might learn a lesson.

And thus it was that at a comparatively early age I took part in the struggle which the
nationalities were waging against one another in the old Austria. When meetings were
held for the South Mark German League and the School League we wore cornflowers
and black-red-gold colours to express our loyalty. We greeted one another with HEIL!
and instead of the Austrian anthem we sang our own DEUTSCHLAND ÃœBER ALLES,
despite warnings and penalties. Thus the youth were educated politically at a time
when the citizens of a so-called national State for the most part knew little of their own
nationality except the language. Of course, I did not belong to the hedgers. Within a
little while I had become an ardent 'German National', which has a different meaning
from the party significance attached to that phrase to-day.
